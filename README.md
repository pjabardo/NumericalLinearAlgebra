# Numerical Linear Algebra
Julia notebooks for Lloyd Treferhen's Numerical Linear Algebra book

Here we have my solutions (working on it) to the problems of the great book Numerical Linear Algebra, Lloyd Trefethen and David Bau.

Over time I will try to solve every exercise proposed and explore the subjects of the book.

I will be using the awesome [the Julia language](https://julialang.org) and [Pluto notebooks](https://plutojl.org/)
